He did his post-doc at the University of Florida until 1988 when he joined Virginia State University (VSU) as an Assistant Professor and later served as Associate Dean and Director of Agricultural Research. At VSU, he secured many grants and conducted research on the fate of pesticides in soils. Dr. Mersie has published extensively on fate of herbicide in the environment and biological control of parthenium (<i>Parthenium hysterophorus</i>). </p>
                    <p>He also served as the principal investigator (PI) of a project on parthenium from 2005 to 2022. The Parthenium Project was part of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Integrated Pest Management, housed at Virginia Tech and funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under cooperative agreement No. AID OAA-L-15-00001. The research-based information presented in this book was generated by this project, which was conducted over seventeen years.</p>

After graduating with her M.Sc., Ms. Chala worked at the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) where she was assigned to the Ambo Plant Protection Research Center. While at Ambo, she conducted the host-range trial for the stem-boring weevil <i>Listronotus setosipennis</i> when it was first introduced to quarantine as a potential biocontrol agent for parthenium.</p>
                            <p>She was also involved in the mass rearing of the leaf-feeding beetle <i>Zygogramma bicolorata</i>, as well as <i>L. setosipennis</i>, field releases of these biological agents, and monitored their establishment in Ethiopia. She has published research that focused on biological control of parthenium. In 2019, Ms. Chala received another M.Sc. in field and vegetable crops from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. She received her Ph.D. in Urban Forestry and Natural Resources from Southern University and A&M College in the United States.</p>
