                    <p class="mb-4">The invasive weed parthenium, known in Ethiopia as ‘kinche arem’ in Amharic, or ‘farmasissa’
                        (meaning ‘sign-away your land’) in Afan Oromiffa, continues to adversely affect agriculture by
                        reducing yields of major food crops such teff (<i>Eragrostis tef</i> (Zucc) Trotter) and sorghum
                        (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> L.). Parthenium also displaces valuable species in pasture lands, thereby
                        negatively impacting livestock production.</p>
                        <p> In the absence of grass, livestock are forced to forage
                        on parthenium, as it is the only green plant in the field during the dry period in many areas. Cows
                        that feed on parthenium produce tainted milk that fetches a lower price in the market. In addition,
                        the tainted milk is rejected by children, and locals believe that it has negative health effects on
                        babies. The weed’s ability to release allelopathic compounds enables it to displace native plants,
                        thereby threatening biodiversity. It is common to find dense, monospecific stands of parthenium
                        in fields in Ethiopia as it has spread to all corners of the country since its introduction, believed
                        to have occurred in the late 1970s.</p>
                         </div>
                                     <p class="mb-4">To tackle the damage caused by parthenium weed, a project entitled “Biological Control of the
                                        Invasive Weed <i>Parthenium hysterophorus</i> in East Africa” was initiated in 2005 and ran until
                                        2022. The project was led by Wondimagegnehu Mersie at Virginia State University, USA and
                                        funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), through the IPM Innovation
                                        Lab Office at Virginia Tech. The goal of the Project was to introduce, evaluate, rear and release
                                        natural enemies of parthenium in Ethiopia, and later on, in Uganda and Kenya. Two natural
                                        enemies of parthenium, the leaf-feeding beetle, <i>Zygogramma bicolorata</i> and the stem-boring
                                        weevil, <i>Listronotus setosipennis</i> were introduced into Ethiopia and field-released after their host-specificity was determined under quarantine conditions and approved by relevant governing
                                        authorities. These two biocontrol agents have now established in various regions of Ethiopia.</p>
                                   
                                        <p class="mb-4">The research-based information generated by the above project was collated in a recently
                                            published book, entitled “Biological Control of Parthenium Weed in Ethiopia”. The book
                                            authored by Wondimagegnehu Mersie and Lidya Alemayhu Chala documents the opportunities,
                                            challenges and accomplishments of the Parthenium Project. It is comprised of 13 chapters, with
                                            text, photos and illustrations. The introduction and second chapter summarize the available
                                            scientific information on the biology of parthenium weed as well as its distribution in Ethiopia.
                                            This is followed with a discussion on the impact of parthenium weed on crops, livestock, human
                                            health as well as on the environment. Chapter 4, deals with current management of the weed. In
                                            chapter 5, the biological control of parthenium is discussed in detail. In this chapter the authors
                                            
                                            describe the steps followed in introducing, rearing and releasing the natural enemies of
                                            parthenium in Ethiopia with diagrams and photos. On chapter 6, results of host range tests
                                            conducted on the leaf-feeding beetle, <i>Zygogramma bicolorata</i> and the stem-boring weevil,
                                            <i>Listronotus setosipennis</i> before they were released is presented. The steps taken and facilities
                                            used to mass rear the two bioagents are explained in chapter 7. In chapter 8, the release of the
                                            two biocontrol agents in different regions of Ethiopia is discussed. On chapters 9 and 10, data on
                                            the establishment of Z. <i>bicolorata</i> and L. <i>setospennis</i>, respectively are presented. The unusually
                                            high incidence of the winter rust (<i>Puccinia abrupta</i> var. <i>partheniicola</i>) in Ethiopia during the
                                            2021 is explained on chapter 11. The authors conclude the book by summarizing the
                                            accomplishments of the Parthenium Project in chapter 12, and finally, in chapter 13, by
                                            acknowledging the support provided to the project by individuals and institutions.</p> 
                                            
                                            
                                    <p class="mb-4">This book provides a useful resource for classroom teaching and the field management of
                                        parthenium weed. The book may also serve as a model to develop biological control measures
                                        for other invasive plant species in Ethiopia and elsewhere. For further information and to order
